# Features

Shipped features, what they do, who owns the code, how to extend them.

## Scaffold

- Owns: `app/_layout.tsx`, `src/shared/theme/`, `src/shared/ui/`, `src/shared/lib/date.ts`.
- Theme: all colors, spacing, radii and type styles. Add a token there before using it.
- UI: `Screen`, `Text`, `Button`, `Card`, `Toggle`. Extend by adding props, not new wrappers.
- Date: `now()` reads an injectable clock. Use `setClock` in tests.
